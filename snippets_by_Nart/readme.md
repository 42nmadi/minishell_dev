I define snippet as a function or set of functions that smoothly fit in our project; think of it as a puzzle piece.

The reason why I'm coding snippets is because I don't want to tinker with our project.

I create snippets to fix certain functions that contain mistakes and to implement features that require a function or more.

Having a folder containing snippets makes it easier to know what I have changed/added to our project.
